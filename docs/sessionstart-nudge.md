# Native session-start adapters

This doc is for operators who need to know which harnesses run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` when a session opens, which only nudge the agent to run it, and how clear, compaction, and resume are handled.
AGENTS.md section 3 is the authoritative behavioral contract for session start.
This file owns how the tracked native session-open adapters deliver it, and the compatibility limits that force two tiers rather than one.

One term recurs throughout:

- The digest is the ordered startup report that `bin/fm-session-start.sh` prints.

## Session-open tiers

Firstmate ships two session-open tiers.
The tier is a property of the harness surface, not of the home.

| Tier | What the adapter does | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run | Executes `bin/fm-session-start.sh` through the native session-open adapter and gates its ordered digest into model context before the first turn. | Claude |
| Nudge | Asks the agent to run the digest through the native adapter or the tracked session-start instruction. | Run-tier sources (`resume`, `reload`, `fork`) routed to the nudge |

### Tier by harness

| Harness surface | Tier | Details |

| Claude | Run | [Claude](#claude) |

### Why the run tier exists

The run tier exists because the nudge can only ask.
An agent can defer an instruction, including when a first-command skill has its own read-only path.
Running the digest through the native adapter removes that discretion, so even a session whose first command is a skill has already taken the helm.

The nudge tier remains the floor for harnesses that cannot carry hook stdout into model context.
It is never a second contract: both tiers end in the same `bin/fm-session-start.sh`.

## Source routing

`bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh` is the single owner of what a session-open source means.
Because of that, no harness matcher string has to encode that policy.
The run wrapper learns the source in one of two ways:

- It takes `--source <name>` when the adapter knows the source natively.
- Otherwise it reads the `source` field from a Claude-shaped JSON hook payload on stdin.

A re-emit (`--reemit`) reprints the digest for a process that already has the helm and lost only its context.

| Source | Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `startup`, `new` | Full digest | This is a true session start that has not taken the helm. |
| `clear`, `compact` | `--reemit` after a proven complete startup, otherwise full digest | This process normally has the helm and lost only its context, but an earlier hook may have been truncated after acquiring the lock. |
| `resume`, `reload`, `fork` | Delegate to the nudge wrapper | Prior context is restored, so re-running is redundant when the lock is still ours and an instruction is enough when a new process resumed an old session. |
| unreadable or unrecognized | Full digest | Taking the helm redundantly is cheap and idempotent; not taking it is the bug this tier exists to fix. |

### Change from the previous nudge matcher

This routing deliberately inverts the previous nudge matcher, which fired on `startup|resume|clear` and excluded `compact`.

- Compaction is covered where a tracked adapter delivers that source, because a compacted session has lost exactly the digest it needs.
- Resume is excluded from the run because it restores that digest instead of losing it.

### Lock and completion interlock

Two records together are the idempotency interlock for the whole scheme:

- Current harness ownership of the lock.
- Its matching `state/.session-start-complete` record.

The full digest updates the completion record in this order:

1. It acquires the lock.
2. It clears the completion record.
3. It republishes the lock owner's pid only after every stage completes.

So `clear` or `compact` cannot skip startup sweeps after a truncated run.

`bin/fm-lock.sh` treats a lock as this session's own when it is owned through either of these:

- The shared ancestry verdict.
- A trusted same-session Claude id.

So a proven `clear` or `compact` re-emit re-verifies ownership and proceeds.
A lock another live session took meanwhile still produces the ordinary read-only digest.

### Nudge wrapper on a run-tier harness

On a run-tier harness, only `resume`, `reload`, and `fork` are routed to the nudge wrapper.
The nudge wrapper has its own separate ancestry-only check, which normally stays silent when this process already holds the lock.
A background Claude helper-chain recycle can break that ancestry.
The wrapper may then emit a redundant nudge even though the shared same-session verdict still owns the lock.
The requested session start remains idempotent.

### Re-emit mechanics

`bin/fm-session-start.sh --reemit` owns these re-emit details:

- Which work a re-emit skips.
- Its true-start AGENTS.md baseline.
- Its supported stale-instruction refresh pairs.

The `bin/fm-session-start.sh` header is the single owner of those mechanics.

## Runtime bound

While the digest runs, the run tier blocks hook-driven session initialization.

So `bin/fm-session-start.sh` bounds itself rather than betting on an unbounded prerequisite.

### Network work stays off the blocking path

The digest makes no external-network call at all.
Every network call it owes runs off the blocking path, in the separately bounded deferred stage owned by `bin/fm-startup-network.sh`.
So an unreachable host can no longer consume this budget.

### Digest timeout

Some digest work remains local but unbounded:

- Tool version probes.
- The backlog listing.

So the whole digest still runs as one bounded child, default 120s via `FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT`.

Each per-task endpoint liveness read runs serially in its own crash-isolated child, bounded by `FM_SESSION_START_ENDPOINT_TIMEOUT` (default 10s; a non-numeric or zero value falls back to the default).
So a read that hangs or dies becomes that task's own `endpoint: error` line and the digest continues.
With a wedged backend the stage's ceiling is tasks times that per-read bound and can itself reach the digest bound.

The per-item backlog row reads inside bootstrap's reconcile and close-replay sweeps are the exception.
Each of those reads is bounded by `FM_BACKLOG_ROW_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 10s) through `bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh`.
The first bound hit latches the sweep.
Later reads in that sweep then return immediately while still naming their own item.

When timeout, gtimeout, and perl are unavailable, the shared timeout owner falls back to a pure-Bash process-group watchdog.
So no supported host runs the digest unbounded.

### When the child stops early

The child streams into the native transport as it runs.
So everything emitted before the child stopped is retained for delivery.
The parent then prints a `STARTUP TRUNCATED` banner on any nonzero child exit, not only the bound, that names:

- The stage that did not finish.
- The stages that were therefore never emitted.
- Whether the child hit its bound or died unexpectedly with its exit status.

The parent still exits 0.
The regression evidence for both shapes is in [`docs/verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#per-task-endpoint-reads-cannot-truncate-the-digest).
The registered hook timeouts sit above that budget, so the harness never preempts the banner.

The deferred startup stage deliberately runs in its own process group under its own deadline.
So a truncated digest does neither of these:

- Kill the network checks and inactive-outcome scan it was not waiting for.
- Orphan unbounded network work.

## Shared wrapper and safety

`bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh` and `bin/fm-sessionstart-nudge.sh` share the same two eligibility owners.

- They source `bin/fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh` and stay silent for a no-mistakes gate agent identified by `NO_MISTAKES_GATE` or a `.no-mistakes/repos/*.git` git-common-dir.
- They share `bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh` with `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`, so every hook uses one primary-detection owner.

A fresh clone has no gitignored state directory yet.
When the root otherwise qualifies as primary, the run wrapper creates the state directory before the unchanged scope check, so the first session takes the helm without a manual `mkdir state`.
If that creation fails, the run wrapper prints one stderr line naming the state directory and the reason, then stands down as it would for any ineligible root.
The nudge wrapper and every other hook still stand down while the state directory is missing.

The Guard Predicates section of [`turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#guard-predicates) owns marker validation, plain-checkout detection, and required Firstmate-shaped paths.

### Nudge payload

The nudge payload has three parts:

- It starts with U+2063 and the stable `FIRSTMATE_OP: ` label.
- It carries the current `session-start` protocol kind.
- It retains exactly ``Run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` now, exactly once, before executing any other instructions.`` as its body.

The Ahoy skill owns the rule that this marked operational input is never a captain-authored session boundary, including its narrow legacy compatibility cases.
The Ahoy skill's own step 0 helm check is the fallback that protects a nudge-tier harness whose first command is a skill.

### Nudge wrapper lock check

Before printing, the nudge wrapper reads `state/.lock` and walks at most eight parents from its own pid.
It does this in its own separate, hard-coded loop, independent of the shared sixteen-hop ancestry walk in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` that `bin/fm-lock.sh` uses for anchor selection and ownership.

If the lock names a live pid in that ancestry, session start already ran in this harness session and the wrapper stays silent.

### Exit codes

Every ordinary transport path in both wrappers exits 0, including malformed state and adapter errors.
The reason is that a Claude SessionStart exit 2 blocks session initialization.

These conditions therefore surface as follows:

- A lock another session holds surfaces as digest text.
- A truncated digest surfaces as digest text.
- Broken GitHub auth surfaces through the deferred network result, inline or as a wake.

None of these becomes a refusal to open the session.

## Harness transports

Each subsection below gives one harness surface's tier, its tracked transport, and its current compatibility.

### Claude

Claude is a run-tier harness.
`.claude/settings.json` registers one unmatched `SessionStart` hook, invoked through `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` with a 180s timeout.
The wrapper reads `source` from the hook payload.
Native stdout context injection is supported.

## Regression coverage

### Wrapper suite

`tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh` is a portable suite.
It proves the nudge wrapper's silence for these cases:

- Both gate signals.
- An unmarked linked worktree.
- A missing state directory.
- An already-owned lock.

It also proves the nudge wrapper's exact U+2063 `FIRSTMATE_OP:`-prefixed, `session-start`-typed one-line output.

It separately proves the run wrapper's silence for the gate environment and an unmarked linked worktree.
It proves the run wrapper creates a missing state directory on a fresh primary and delivers the full digest, while an unmarked linked worktree gets none.
It proves a fresh primary whose state directory cannot be created reports that on one stderr line and stands down without a digest.

It proves the run wrapper's source routing end to end against a real `fm-session-start.sh`, including:

- Completion-gated `--reemit` selection.
- Resume delegation.
- An unrecognized source falling through to the full digest.

### Runtime bound test

`tests/fm-session-start.test.sh` proves the runtime bound through the forced pure-Bash fallback.
It uses a TERM-resistant digest that exceeds its budget and proves that the digest:

- Is force-killed with its grandchild.
- Still emits its completed stages.
- Names the incomplete stage and every stage it never reached.
- Leaves no completion proof.
- Exits 0.

### Live run-tier guard

`tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh` is the opt-in live guard for the Claude run-tier adapter.
It confirms the installed adapter invokes the run wrapper and delivers its output into context.
It verifies context-preserving reopen sources and context-reset delivery wherever the tracked TUI surface is reachable.

### Guard, monitoring, and away-mode tests

`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` and `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh` cover marked guard, monitoring, and away-mode delivery.

### Transport evidence

[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#native-session-start-delivery) records the active version-scoped transport evidence.
