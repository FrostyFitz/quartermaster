# Live guard for bin/fm-busy-lib.sh's launch-prompt backstop (live-harness-optin
# family). Per .agents/skills/coding-guidelines "Harness-dependent
# checks", a classifier built on vendor-rendered dialog text must be proven
# against the REAL installed harness, because a stub can only confirm the
# assumption already written into the stub.
#
# quartermaster ships Claude Code as the sole verified harness, so this guard
# only ever launches a real claude process; a live e2e test never launches a
# real non-Claude harness binary.
#
# For the installed claude, this drives the REAL binary in an isolated tmux
# server into its genuine interactive launch prompt (a fresh untrusted
# worktree), captures the pane with the exact production shape
# (bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_tmux_capture: `tmux capture-pane -p -S
# -40`), arms a scratch busy-state record exactly as fm-spawn.sh does at
# launch, and requires fm_busy_classify to report `unknown launch-prompt`
# instead of the record's seeded `busy fm-spawn`. No prompt is ever
# submitted and no dialog is ever answered (Escape only, never Enter), so no
# model tokens are spent and no operator credential store is written to. An
# absent harness binary is reported explicitly and skipped rather than
# silently passing over it; a run that checked nothing fails.
#
# Precondition: this machine's default `claude` config must already be past
# first-run onboarding (a subscription or API key already selected, and a
# theme already chosen) - the guard targets a brand-new SCRATCH WORKTREE under
# the operator's own already-onboarded config, exactly the shape a real
# crewmate spawn produces, never a fresh CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. An unonboarded
# machine reports that precondition explicitly rather than failing the
# signature.
#
# Run explicitly with FM_LAUNCH_PROMPT_SIGNALS_LIVE=1. Refresh
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md ("Launch-prompt backstop signatures")
# from this guard's output after any Claude Code upgrade.
